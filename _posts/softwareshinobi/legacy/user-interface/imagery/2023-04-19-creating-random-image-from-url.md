Sometimes you just need a trivial cover image for a peice of content.

## introduction

Sometimes you just need a trivial cover image for a peice of content.

Nobody has time to find an appropriate stubbed image, just to fill out content.

When the situation arises, just use the following URL to generate a random image for your content.

## how i use this

i use this for mocking user interfaces and article cover images.

there are better ways, but using this site gives me nice colorful images.

## use this url

```
https://random.imagecdn.app/820/360
```

## using with html

```html
<img src="https://random.imagecdn.app/820/360" alt= "" width="820" height="360">
```

## using with markdown

```
![random image](https://random.imagecdn.app/820/360)
```
