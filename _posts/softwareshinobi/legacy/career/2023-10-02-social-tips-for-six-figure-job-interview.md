Any advice for someone going through first rounds of interviews for a six figure salary?

## social media question

Any advice for someone going through first rounds of interviews for a six figure salary?

Also, is there anyone in here who is earning this kind of salary without a masters degree?

I’m currently set to graduate in May - but I feel like they may overlook me because I don’t already have it.

I meet all the qualifications and then sommmme.. but this would be the most I’ve ever made before - definitely would be stepping into my career with this position.

if you go in thinking you will be overlooked, then you will be over looked.

so much of life, or existence, or consciousness, or whatever this is...

is a mental process.

meaning that so much (all?) of 'this' is happening in our heads.

and what is happening in our heads, comes out. a number of ways, known and unknown.

if you walk in thinking that you aint bout to get this job b/c it's so much money and b/c you are this... and b/c you are that... and b/c you aint got...

then what energy will you start giving off? that you likely aren't aware of.
something to think about.

in all seriousness i say the following:

'just care less. care less about the outcome'.

it'll do wonders for you. i mean it.

also, gary vee is famous for saying:

"the at-bat is more important than whether you struck out or got on base"
