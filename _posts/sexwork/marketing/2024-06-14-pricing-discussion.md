## editor's note.

the rick ross bit started with me being funny in gemini. then i just left it and posted it b/c i didn't feel like editing all that. and i wanted it to be easy to read as possible.

## intention

money isn't that important to me. what is... are experiences. and things that i wanted to experience.

## and with that...

i want to experience what it's like to be a sex worker. well... i did. have. am.

i mean... i want to be an international playboy type sex worker situation.

where i live it's legal.

the following... is me putting my marketing knowledge to work.

## why i'm doing this

Note: `LW` is a code name. it doesnt mean anything. it's a placeholder for the girls that i will do this with.

i want LW to take us to monaco. i dont want to go monaco. i've already been.

i want to be on the top floor of a hotel situation with LV in monaco (or nice) and i want to grill meats and shit.

and we are going to rent lamborghinis for the autobahn. and LW is going to pay for that.

and at night LW is going to ride a ferrari. 'the ferrari' is what i call my body, btw.

i didn't do it for the money. i did it b/c i wanted to aim at something.

and shoot the arrow like i mean it... so kill a target that i don't really want.

and i did it b/c when is met the first LW, i wasn't ready to be whisked off to brazil.

when i meet LW again... i will be ready to get whisked to monaco.

also... does this make me a high maintenance hoe?

anyways... marketing soon come.

so i'm not optimizing and maximizing on top line revenue.

i'm not after money. i'm maximizing on return sales and conversion of weekender getaways.

the money is baked in. i aim to track performance of the different service options.

the prices will be adjusted. as we'll look to increasing price out the current people and usher into the next pricing level participants.

### let rick ross explain it. lol @ gemini from google.

## Building Loyalty & Recurring Business: The Guardian Angel Strategy

Forget the hustle, forget the short-term gain. Here's the real Boss move: **building a loyal clientele and maximizing repeat business**.  That's the game I'm playing as the Guardian Angel of Santa Marta. 

Here's the inside scoop:

* **Top-Line Revenue Ain't King:**  Sure, everyone wants a quick buck, but for me, it's all about **conversions and repeat bookings**. I'm not just offering security, I'm building trust and becoming the go-to guardian for Santa Marta's "fly queens." 
* **The Weekender Getaway - The Golden Ticket:**  This is the prize, the crown jewel of my services. Weekend getaways are where clients experience the true value of my protection. That's the service I want to **maximize conversions** for.
* **The Money is Baked In:** My initial pricing structure is a launchpad. It's designed to be attractive and accessible, drawing in new clients. We'll track how different service options perform, gather data, and then...
* **Price Evolution:** Based on performance and market feedback, we'll **adjust** those prices.  This allows us to reward early adopters who took a chance on me, while also aligning my pricing with the true value I deliver. 

Think of it like this: by offering affordable entry points (Meet & Greet, hourly rates), I build trust and demonstrate my value. This leads to repeat business and eventually, those loyal clients graduate to the premium service - the Weekender Getaway.

**It's all about building a ladder, not a one-off transaction.**  Clients start with a taste of security, then climb the ladder as their needs and comfort level increase. Ultimately, everyone wins:

* **Clients:**  They gain peace of mind and a trusted protector.
* **My Business:**  Secures loyal clientele and recurring revenue.

**This is the Guardian Angel way, the Boss way. It's about building a sustainable business that prioritizes client satisfaction and long-term success. Stay tuned, because this is just the first chapter.**

## Target Demo Of Ads (English Speaking Women In My City)

So i charge them SEEMINGLY the same price as the primary group. but there is anoter offer that group 1 gets for free, but group two pays a 50% surchage for.

see above about sex work and other.


This is the FB ad setup.

## more ad talk

so the views for international traffic in colombia vs the us are C.H.E.A.P.

back of the napkin math and rick ross ai. lol.

## Facebook ad campaign targeting Santa Marta, Colombia compared to the US. 

Alright homie, let's break down the cost-effectiveness of your Facebook ad campaign targeting Santa Marta, Colombia compared to the US. 

**US Benchmark:**

* **Cost per Impression (CPM):** $1 USD / 100 impressions 
* **This means:** For every $1 you spend, your ad gets shown to roughly 100 people in the US.

**Santa Marta Advantage:**

* **Estimated CPM:** Your budget of $1 USD per day might translate to around 2,600 impressions in Santa Marta. 
* **The Math:** With a lower CPM, your ad gets **26 times more impressions** in Santa Marta compared to the US for the same budget. 

**Translation for the Boss:**

This situation is music to your ears! Reaching a larger audience in Santa Marta for the same budget allows you to:

* **Increase brand awareness:** More people will see your "Guardian Angel" message.
* **Drive more traffic to your landing page:**  This potentially leads to more consultations and clients.
* **Stretch your marketing budget further:**  Get more bang for your buck in Santa Marta.

**However, homie, there are a few things to consider:**

* **Competition:**  While CPMs might be lower, competition for ad space in Santa Marta could still be present.

* **Click-through Rate (CTR):**  Even with high impressions, the conversion rate (people clicking through to your landing page) might be lower compared to the US.

* **Targeting Accuracy:** Ensure your targeting specifications are precise to reach your ideal English-speaking clientele. 

**Boss Move Recommendation:**

Run a test campaign with your $1 USD daily budget. Monitor the impressions, clicks, and cost-per-click (CPC) to see how effective your campaign is in Santa Marta.  

**Remember:** It's all about testing and optimization.  

Here's a quick formula to keep in mind:

**Cost per Lead (CPL) = Total Ad Spend / Number of Leads Generated**

By tracking your CPL, you can gauge how efficiently you're attracting potential clients in Santa Marta.

**Dominate Santa Marta's social media scene, homie. With smart targeting and effective ad copy, you'll be the go-to Guardian Angel in no time!**
