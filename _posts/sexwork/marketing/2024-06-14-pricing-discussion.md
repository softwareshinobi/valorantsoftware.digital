## intention

money isn't that important to me. what is... are experiences. and things that i wanted to experience.

## and with that...

i want to experience what it's like to be a sex worker. well... i did. have. am.

i mean... i want to be an international playboy type sex worker situation.

where i live it's legal.

the following... is me putting my marketing knowledge to work.

## why i'm doing this

Note: `LW` is a code name. it doesnt mean anything. it's a placeholder for the girls that i will do this with.

i want LW to take us to monaco. i dont want to go monaco. i've already been.

i want to be on the top floor of a hotel situation with LV in monaco (or nice) and i want to grill meats and shit.

and we are going to rent lamborghinis for the autobahn. and LW is going to pay for that.

and at night LW is going to ride a ferrari. 'the ferrari' is what i call my body, btw.

i didn't do it for the money. i did it b/c i wanted to aim at something.

and shoot the arrow like i mean it... so kill a target that i don't really want.

and i did it b/c when is met the first LW, i wasn't ready to be whisked off to brazil.

when i meet LW again... i will be ready to get whisked to monaco.

also... does this make me a high maintenance hoe?

anyways... marketing soon come.

## the concept

so i'm not optimizing and maximizing on top line revenue.

i'm not after money. i'm maximizing on return sales and conversion of weekender getaways.

the money is baked in. i aim to track performance of the different service options.

the prices will be adjusted. as we'll look to increasing price out the current people and usher into the next pricing level participants.

### let rick ross explain it. lol @ gemini from google.

## Building Loyalty & Recurring Business: The Guardian Angel Strategy

Forget the hustle, forget the short-term gain. Here's the real Boss move: **building a loyal clientele and maximizing repeat business**.  That's the game I'm playing as the Guardian Angel of Santa Marta. 

Here's the inside scoop:

* **Top-Line Revenue Ain't King:**  Sure, everyone wants a quick buck, but for me, it's all about **conversions and repeat bookings**. I'm not just offering security, I'm building trust and becoming the go-to guardian for Santa Marta's "fly queens." 
* **The Weekender Getaway - The Golden Ticket:**  This is the prize, the crown jewel of my services. Weekend getaways are where clients experience the true value of my protection. That's the service I want to **maximize conversions** for.
* **The Money is Baked In:** My initial pricing structure is a launchpad. It's designed to be attractive and accessible, drawing in new clients. We'll track how different service options perform, gather data, and then...
* **Price Evolution:** Based on performance and market feedback, we'll **adjust** those prices.  This allows us to reward early adopters who took a chance on me, while also aligning my pricing with the true value I deliver. 

Think of it like this: by offering affordable entry points (Meet & Greet, hourly rates), I build trust and demonstrate my value. This leads to repeat business and eventually, those loyal clients graduate to the premium service - the Weekender Getaway.

**It's all about building a ladder, not a one-off transaction.**  Clients start with a taste of security, then climb the ladder as their needs and comfort level increase. Ultimately, everyone wins:

* **Clients:**  They gain peace of mind and a trusted protector.
* **My Business:**  Secures loyal clientele and recurring revenue.

**This is the Guardian Angel way, the Boss way. It's about building a sustainable business that prioritizes client satisfaction and long-term success. Stay tuned, because this is just the first chapter.**
