## From Meta/Facebook

Adult Products or Services

Ads must not promote the sale or use of adult products or services. Ads promoting sexual and reproductive health products or services, like contraception and family planning, must be targeted to people 18 years or older and must not focus on sexual pleasure.

Advertisers can run ads that promote sexual health, wellness and reproductive products and services. However, as a global company, we need to take into account the wide array of people from different cultures and countries who see ads across our technologies to avoid potential negative experiences. That is why we place additional restrictions on these ads, including the requirement to target audiences 18 years or older.

Website. You’ll definitely want to have a nice website built with retargeting pixels installed. With that, you have a place to drive traffic and generate leads.

Advertising. I’ve heard that Pornhub has very cost-effective advertising rates. You can also look into advertising on dating apps and similar places. Backpage and Craigslist should be low-hanging fruit for cheap/free ads.

Build an email list. When people go to your site, you generally want to get their info somehow. Email is a more intimate form of communication but still safe enough for both parties. Email should be your core marketing strategy.

If visitors offer their email in exchange for some incentive (i.e. previewing escorts, some photo or video, etc.), then you have a solid chance in getting more conversions.

Influencers. Leveraging influencers and building up your social channels to become an influencer, yourself, is a great strategy to build your brand while driving traffic to your site.

There are a lot of models on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. Reach out and have them promote you in exchange for a fee. 

You’ll also want to be transparent with them, because just because they’re a model doesn’t mean they will approve of your practice.

Also, pay them for advice on social media growth strategies or to even manage your accounts.
